# Add comment to Blog post Blockchain 

In this tutorial, you will create a new message module called comment. The module will let you read and write comments to an existing blog post.

You can only add comments to post which are no older than 100 Blocks. 

**Note:** This value has been hard coded to a low number for rapid testing. You can increase it to a greater number to achieve longer period of time before commenting is not allowed.

### Prerequisites:

- This tutorial is an extension of previously written blog tutorial. Make sure you complete that first before proceeding with this tutorial.
- This tutorial also assumes basic knowledge of blog tutorial implementation.
